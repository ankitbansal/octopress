    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many developers find it difficult to understand <em>this</em> keyword in javascript. Its more often with developers coming from java background as the way <em>this</em> works in java is quiet different from that in javascript. While in java, <em>this</em> refers to the object whose method is being called. In javascript, <em>this</em> refers to the object in whose context method is invoked also called ‘current execution context’. In this article, I will try to clear up some of the confusions by going through various examples. Before we dive into how <em>this</em> is determined, let&rsquo;s understand what is execution context.</p>

<h3>What is Execution Context:</h3>

<p>When a javascript code run, the environment in which it is evaluated is called execution context.
All javascript code is guaranteed to run in some execution context. By default, execution context
is global.</p>

<p>When a javascript function is called, a new execution context is created and is pushed
to the top of the execution stack. If another function is called inside current function, it
will create a new execution context and  push it to the top of execution stack. Once the
function completes execution, its execution context is popped off making new execution
context to the context below it.</p>

<p>The thing to understand is, every time execution context is changed, <em>this</em> gets reassigned to the object in whose
execution context is invoked.</p>

<p>Let’s go through some of the function invocations and figure out what this will resolve to:</p>

<h3>Global Inovcation</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// this points to window</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">someRef</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">someRef</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// this points to window</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&lsquo;hello&rsquo; method over here is not associated with any object. So, it runs in global execution context. Thus, <em>this</em> over here points to &lsquo;window&rsquo; which is the default global object in the case of browser.
The same goes true for method &lsquo;someRef&rsquo;.</p>

<h3>Object Invocation</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="nx">bar</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">hello</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bar</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//this points to foo</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this example, we have created an object called foo and calling method of bar which refers to our previously defined hello method. Since, bar method is the current execution context, <em>this</em> refers to its object which is foo.</p>

<p>Another way to define an object is via constructor:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">baz</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">someRef</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">baz</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">someRef</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bar</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//this points to baz</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you might have guessed, <em>this</em> over here will refer to baz object.</p>

<p>How about if we add a prototype method:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">baz</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">prototype</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">barPrototype</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">hello</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">someRef</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">baz</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">someRef</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">barPrototype</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// this refers to baz object</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Again, over here <em>this</em> will refer to baz object.</p>

<h3>Invocation using apply, call and bind</h3>

<p>The next set is of functions allows you to explicitly specify <em>this</em> value. These methods are Call, Apply and Bind Methods.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{};</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//apply</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">apply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//this points to foo</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//call</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//this points to foo</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//bind</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">someRef</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">someRef</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//this points to foo</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Call and apply immediately invokes the function. While bind allow you to set the function context that can be invoked at later point of time.</p>

<h3>Invocation using eval</h3>

<p>The eval function provides capability of dynamic execution of JavaScript code represented as a string.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">bar</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">“</span><span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="err">”</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bar</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//this points to global object</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this case, <em>this</em> will refer to Window. Let’s see why. When we invoke bar <em>this</em> was called with foo,
but inside bar function, eval invokes hello without referring an object, so it goes through global scope.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p><em>this</em> is very powerful in javascript and many libraries utilize it at its core. I hope this blog have helped you in clearing some of the doubts and gaining a better understanding of how <em>this</em> evaluates in javascript.</p>

    <id>http://www.ankitbansal.net/blog/2013/06/12/getting-db-connection-pool-right</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently during performance testing, we found that our database connection pool size was way too high which resulted in bad performance of the system as we increased the load. This was due to not giving enough thought while increasing the connection pool a couple of months back when we faced a latency issue. So, the question was what should be the optimum value for connection pool size and how should we determine it. We were using Oracle as the database for our project.</p>

<p>To calculate the required connection pool size, we first established the most frequent request and the time  spent in the db on average in order to process that request. This turned out to be the creation/update of an order record.
On the basis of our usage model we expect 2500 users to be ordering concurrently and overall 300 orders to be requested per second. Looking at the server logs it takes around 250ms on average to fulfil an order request, out of which 100ms is spent in the db. So, for 300 requests to be processed within a second, we would need 30 connections on average. Similarly we identified the other most frequent requests and were able to calculate the average and maximum concurrent number of connections required.</p>

<p>One of the things worth mentioning is that we are not using any database level cache in our system. If we were then we would have to take this into account when calculating the number of actual database hits.</p>

<p>The results with the new connection pool size were good &ndash; the latency in responding to requests was significantly reduced compared to when we had the very large connection pool. We also had a chat with the DBA who confirmed that the number of active connections was in the same ballpark as we had calculated. It would have been really useful for the development team to be able to monitor the number of active connections directly, but lack of access rights meant this wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p>

<p>Getting the connection pool size right not only improved the request latency, but also addressed some other issues we were experiencing. Attempting to run with too many connections was leading to some serious paging issues with the buffer cache.</p>

<p>In conclusion, choosing the right connection pool size is an important task in performance tuning an application, and accepting the defaults can result in serious degradation.</p>

<p>It would be good to hear other people&rsquo;s experiences with setting connection pool sizes, what approaches have worked well and what to avoid.</p>
